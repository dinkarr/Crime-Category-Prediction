# Predicting Crime Categories
Predicting crime based on features.

## Overview
Welcome to the Crime Case repository! This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of crime incidents to develop predictive models that forecast the category of crime. The insights derived from this analysis aim to enhance law enforcement strategies and improve public safety.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset provides a detailed snapshot of criminal activities, including various attributes of each incident. The key components of the dataset include:

### Data Files
- **train.csv**: The primary dataset used for training models, containing the target variable `crime_category` along with relevant feature attributes.
- **test.csv**: This file contains similar features but excludes the target variable, as it is used for validation purposes (not utilized in this project due to lack of actual labels).
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample format for submission files.

### Columns Description
- **Location**: Street address of the crime incident.
- **Cross_Street**: Cross street of the rounded address.
- **Latitude**: Latitude coordinates of the crime incident.
- **Longitude**: Longitude coordinates of the crime incident.
- **Date_Reported**: Date the incident was reported.
- **Date_Occurred**: Date the incident occurred.
- **Time_Occurred**: Time the incident occurred in 24-hour military time.
- **Area_ID**: LAPD's Geographic Area number.
- **Area_Name**: Name designation of the LAPD Geographic Area.
- **Reporting_District_no**: Reporting district number.
- **Part 1-2**: Crime classification.
- **Modus_Operandi**: Activities associated with the suspect.
- **Victim_Age**: Age of the victim.
- **Victim_Sex**: Gender of the victim.
- **Victim_Descent**: Descent code of the victim.
- **Premise_Code**: Premise code indicating the location of the crime.
- **Premise_Description**: Description of the premise code.
- **Weapon_Used_Code**: Weapon code indicating the type of weapon used.
- **Weapon_Description**: Description of the weapon code.
- **Status**: Status of the case.
- **Status_Description**: Description of the status code.
- **Crime_Category**: The category of the crime (Target Variable).

## Project Goals
